# MovieLogger
Test Spring Project

This is a test project using the Spring framework and JPA repositories.
It represents a Movie logging database, where users can log different movies, actors and genres.
The database (PostgreSQL) contains 4 tables (movies, users, actors and genres).
Future developments will include a security update (basic authentification) and a broader query flexibility.
